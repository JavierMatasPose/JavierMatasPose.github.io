# AI Engineer and PhD candidate

I am a Telecommunications Engineer, with deep passion for lifelong learning and a strong drive to craft innovative solutions for the future. I find joy in the fields of engineering, deep learning, and tackling new challenges. Furthermore, I possess valuable experience in translating abstract concepts into practical solutions through theoretical analysis and real-world problem-solving.

Additionally, I bring a robust background in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning, signal processing, and computer vision to the table. I'm fully prepared to make significant contributions in these areas.

At present, I am actively working full time while pursuing a PhD to further explore the boundless possibilities and practical applications of AI in financial markets.

#### Technical Skills: Python, SQL, Java or Qlik among others

## Personal Projects
### Artificial Intelligence in financial markets. Master's thesis
I have developed and implemented an artificial intelligence in a financial market simulation environment, which buys and sells shares automatically through a real broker. It is Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning, taking inspiration from AlphaZero and AlphaTensor. It has traded automatically on the Nasdaq, and has been awarded 3rd place in an international competition for quantitative trading algorithms, named Robotrader.
Additionally, I had the honour to present it at the Madrid Stock Exchange, in a talk I gave on AI for trading (in Spanish). Starting at 1:32:45, at this link:
